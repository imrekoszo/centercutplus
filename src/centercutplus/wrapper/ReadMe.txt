The purpose of this project is to provide objects that
wrap the whole center cut plus lifecycle:

- creating and initializing the engine
- setting and wiring up the configuration system
- tearing down the whole stuff when needed

What this library will need to be passed:
- implemented config views to be initialized
- an implementation of the config save/load interfaces
